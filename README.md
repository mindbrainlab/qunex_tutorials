QuNex Guides and Tutorials
==========================

This repository hosts guides and tutorials on use of [QuNex](https://qunex.yale.edu), a **Q**uantitative **N**euroimaging **E**nvironment & Toolbo**x**, an open-source software for neuroimaging data preprocessing and analysis developed jointly by the [Mind & Brain Lab](https://mblab.si) at the University in Ljubljana, and the [Anticevic](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/anticevic/) and the [Murray](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/) labs at Yale University. The repository holds example use cases of QuNex, explanations of QuNex commands, file types, and data organization, and various other information provided to help use QuNex efficiently. The tutorials are primarily developed by Mind & Brain Lab members, however, community contributions in form of pull requests are welcome. The guides and tutorials are also available on [QuNex Blog](https://mblab.si/qunex/).

We will make our best effort to keep guides and tutorials current and update them with any changes to QuNex functionality. Each guide or tutorial will list the version of QuNex that it was written with or updated for. This should ensure that they work with that version of QuNex, and most probably also with any later version unless breaking changes were introduced that the tutorial or guide was not yet updated for.
